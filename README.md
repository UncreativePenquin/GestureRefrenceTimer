Find online at https://gesturetimer.netlify.app
do gesture drawing practice using your own files

if you don't have files they have some good free ones in CubeBrush

you can do whatever you want with the code

yes this is pretty scuff, I don't know how to do html coding stuff

I made this because I wanted to have more control over the refrences i saw and didn't wanna spend money, hope this helps some people
